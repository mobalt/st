# st - simple terminal emulator

*st* is a lightweight terminal emulator made by the good people
at suckless.org. This is my repo has my configurations baked in.

I've installed the following patches (in that order):
1. clipboard
2. vertcenter
3. ~~delkey~~ - a mistake. Incompatible with vim.
4. externalpipe
5. anysize
6. scrollback
7. ~~colorschemes~~ - ability to add and switch from 10 colorschemes. But active
colorscheme is not saved, so if you open another st instance, would have to re-activate colorscheme. Besides, I would rather manage colorschemes using Xresources anyway. That way
active colorscheme is available to other programs that also use Xresources.
8. ~~keyboard_select~~ - very limited vim emulation. I would rather externalpipe directly to vim, and get full functionality.

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need several header files.

In Ubuntu, run this to install required header files:
```shell
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxinerama-dev
```


Installation
------------
If needed, edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Build and install:
```shell
sudo make clean install
```
